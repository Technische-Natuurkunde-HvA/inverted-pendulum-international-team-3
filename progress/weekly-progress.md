# About this document

This is a team document where you record your weekly progress. It is written in Markdown, which allows you to format content in a simple and readable way. The document is rendered directly in GitHub without the need for a compiler (unlike LaTeX). The syntax is relatively easy. An overview of commonly used Markdown syntax can be found here:  
https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/

Below you find an example of the sections that must be included in each weekly progress report.

Use the **same document for all weeks**. For each week, use the **same headers and subheaders**.

Use the GitHub repository to store important project files (code, visuals including videos and figures, data, etc.). If necessary refer to those files in this document using a hyperlink.

# Week 1

## 1. Progress description
We made a plan to make a wheel and a measurement protocol. We decided that team Lisbon will design the wheel and team Amsterdam will make the measurement protocol.

## 2. Code
For code, we will use the pre-written C# code to measure the PWM values.



## 3. Results
We had workshops and made a plan for the next week.

## 4. Reflection 
We have learnt how to work as an international team and what impacts culture differences has on an international team and how to deal with (if any) problems caused by cultural differences.

# Week 2

## 1. Progress description
HVA team: This week we did the PWM measurements with incrementing steps of 50.
We made a graph of these measurements set out against The RPM value.

## 2. Code

## 3. Results

## 4. Reflection 
HVA team: We are going to do the measurements again with incrementing steps of 5 like out interntational side of the team have done. 

## 5. Measurement protocol
**At which PWM values will you measure?:**

- *The PWM value goes from 0  to 255. We will measure it with increments of 5. Then we will plot the PWM values against the rpm values and put a fit-function in the graph to get an equation to go from PWM to rpm.*

**How many measurements will you perform at each PWM value? How long will each measurement last?:**

- *1 measurement per PWM value and measure it when the motor rotates at a constant speed.*

**The motor can rotate in two directions. How will you account for this in your measurements?:**

- *We will measure it only at one direction.*

**Which software will you use to collect and process your data?:**
    
- *We will use Arduino IDE to run the program and collect the data and python to process it.*

**An example of the graph you expect to produce:**
