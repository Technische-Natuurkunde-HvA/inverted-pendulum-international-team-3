# About this document

This is a team document where you record your weekly progress. It is written in Markdown, which allows you to format content in a simple and readable way. The document is rendered directly in GitHub without the need for a compiler (unlike LaTeX). The syntax is relatively easy. An overview of commonly used Markdown syntax can be found here:  
https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/

Below you find an example of the sections that must be included in each weekly progress report.

Use the **same document for all weeks**. For each week, use the **same headers and subheaders**.

Use the GitHub repository to store important project files (code, visuals including videos and figures, data, etc.). If necessary refer to those files in this document using a hyperlink.

# Week 1

## 1. Progress description
Describe the progress of your work for this week. Keep it clear and concise.

## 2. Code

You can display code using three backticks (```) followed by an optional language extension.  
For example:  
- For C/C++ code, use `c` or `cpp`.  
- For Python, use `python`.



#### Example:

```c
// Header file for input/output functions
#include <stdio.h>

// Main function: entry point for execution
int main() {

    // Print a message to the console
    printf("Hello World");

    return 0;
}
``` 
## 3. Results
Present your results here. This may include tables, figures, or charts.
Add charts and other visuals to the `visuals` folder in the GitHub repository and reference them in this document if needed.


## 4. Reflection 
What did you learn this week?
What should you focus on or improve in the coming weeks of the project?

## 4. Reflection 
HVA team: monday we are going to do a neww measurement with PWM values with increments of 5. 
The international part of the team has done it this way. 
Then we are going to catch up with the international side of the team by implementing the measurements into the code and getting the pendulem working.
