# Reaction Wheel Inverted Pendulum - Team 3

This project was carried out by an international team of students at the
Technische Natuurkunde program (HvA). The objective is to stabilize an
inverted pendulum using a reaction wheel driven by an electric motor.

## 1. Project Motivation

The inverted pendulum is an interesting project for the experimentation with control of a system. The materials needed for this project are not too expensive and most parts can be 3D printed. 

## 2. System Overview

## 3. Control Principle

## 4. Implementation

### 4.1 Arduino Control Software

### 4.2 Python Tools

For the gathing of data from the Arduino we used the /inverted-pendulum-international-team-3/code/save_info_to_csv.py script. 

For the visualisation of the data we used the /inverted-pendulum-international-team-3/code/plot_data.ipynb script.

## 5. Experiments and Data
We had to kalibrate the motor to give the correct RPM for the given PWM values.
