- The weekly progress update is much too brief. It also does not include any code or graphs. In particular, the combined graph of both output-response curves is missing.
- The Arduino sketch for the swinging the pendulum has not been uploaded.
- Great you included a video!
- In general, your repository is incomplete. Next week, you need to submit a detailed and complete weekly progress report.

General recommendations to all teams:
- Place your weekly progress reports in reverse order, with the most recent week at the top.
- Do not be afraid of Markdown. If you wish, you could start by writing a basic text file in Word and later convert it to Markdown.
- Always add annotations or description to all graphs, pictures, videos, code and data you share in your weekly progress report. Do not assume these are self-explanatory; your readers rely on your explanations to understand their relevance and importance.
- The weekly progress reports form the foundation of your final written product. The more clear, detailed, and comprehensive your reports are, the better prepared you will be to complete your final product.
